## About Me
Hi! My name is Derek and I am currently a junior majoring in computer science at UCI. In terms of what my interests are in computer science, I want to learn more about full-stack development and the implementation of Azure functions. I have very little experience with these areas, but I hope to learn more about them and their usages during this iteration of the camp. Outside of coding, some of my hobbies are playing tennis, working out, going to festivals, and going to new places to eat. I'm not definite on what my project is, but I want it to be related to fitness, or anything else that comes to mind throughout the weeks.
